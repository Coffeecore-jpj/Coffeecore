    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Hi!, I'm the maker behind Coffeecore.
      Growing up I saw so much unnecessary plastic waste like huge plastic billboards that would just get thrown away.
      Even as a kid, it stuck with me: If I ever build a business, it had to be eco friendly.
      So, coffeecore is a small shop built from home, </p>
